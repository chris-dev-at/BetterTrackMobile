/**
 * Realized-P/L & tax engine — pure domain core (V3-P4, §13.3, issue #331).
 *
 * The money-math rulebook behind Settings → Taxes: EUR-denominated
 * moving-average cost basis, per-sell realized gain/loss, calendar-year
 * bucketing (Europe/Vienna), the Austrian flat-KESt settlement with same-year
 * loss offset, and the manual per-trade tax entry. Like the rest of
 * `domain/**` this is T1 code with **no imports at all** — no DB, HTTP,
 * contracts, providers, or clock. Everything is a pure function of its inputs;
 * the service layer owns FX conversion (transactions arrive here already in
 * EUR at their trade-date rates), persistence, and movement posting.
 *
 * **Cost basis (Austria-correct method).** Austria taxes realized capital
 * gains against the *moving average* acquisition price (gleitender
 * Durchschnittspreis), not FIFO tax lots. {@link realizedSellsEur} replays a
 * transaction log chronologically: a BUY re-averages
 * `avg = (held·avg + qty·price + fee) / (held + qty)` and a SELL realizes
 * `qty·(price − avg) − fee` without changing the average — exactly the
 * semantics of `holdings.reducePosition`, but denominated in **EUR at each
 * trade's own date** (§16 2026-07-08): acquisition cost enters at the buy-day
 * rate and proceeds at the sell-day rate, so FX moves are part of the taxable
 * gain, as they are for KESt.
 *
 * **Year ledger (the AT settlement rule).** Within one Vienna calendar year,
 * the tax **held** for a portfolio must always equal
 *
 *     target(year) = round( AT_KEST_RATE · max(0, pool(year)) )
 *
 * where `pool(year)` is the sum of realized gains/losses of AT-taxed sells
 * plus gross AT-taxed dividends of that year. Every recorded event settles
 * the *delta* between the new target and what is already held: a positive
 * delta is a withholding, a negative one a refund ("a loss sell refunds tax
 * already paid that year down to the year's net position"). Because the pool
 * is clamped at zero, tax held is never negative — a January loss with no
 * prior gains simply parks in the pool and offsets later same-year gains. The
 * year resets hard on Jan 1: {@link settleAtYear} only ever sees one year's
 * events, and the caller buckets by {@link viennaYearOf} — there is no carry
 * across years by construction.
 *
 * **Rounding.** Averages, pools and gains stay at full FP precision (§5.4 —
 * no mid-computation rounding); only *settlement deltas* — amounts that
 * become stored movements — are quantized to whole cents via a local
 * {@link floorCents} (the V3-P0 lesson, #322). The quantizer mirrors
 * `cashLedger.floorCents` exactly; it is re-declared here because `domain/**`
 * modules import nothing (a value import would breach the purity rule), and
 * its parity is pinned by tests on both sides.
