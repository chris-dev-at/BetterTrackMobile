/**
 * Portfolio cash ledger ("Bargeld") — pure domain core (V2-P6, issues #220/#274).
 *
 * A **pure** money-math engine for the per-portfolio cash balance. Like the
 * rest of `domain/**` this is T1 code with **no imports of DB, HTTP, contracts,
 * providers, or the clock** — the only import is the {@link FlowPoint} *type*
 * from `./holdings`, so the external-flow series composes directly with
 * {@link timeWeightedReturn}. The `portfolio_cash_movements` table, repository,
 * service wiring, and overview UI land in a later V2-P6 issue; this module is
 * the authoritative rulebook they will call into.
 *
 * **V3-P3 — cash sources.** The single ledger became **Main** plus named
 * sibling sources: every movement belongs to one source, the portfolio ledger
 * is the union of all sources' movements (so every roll-up here keeps working
 * on the union), solvency is checked **per source**
 * ({@link projectCashLedgerBySource}), transfers between sources are paired
 * `transfer_out`/`transfer_in` legs that cancel to zero in every sum and are
 * never TWR flows ({@link pairedTransferMovements}), and "set balance to X"
 * reduces to a normal deposit/withdrawal carrying the computed delta
 * ({@link setBalanceMovement}).
 *
 * **V5 — the `fee` kind** (§16 2026-07-30). A standing custody / account /
 * platform fee is its own movement kind rather than a `withdrawal`, because the
 * two mean opposite things to the return: a withdrawal is the owner taking money
 * out (external, divided back out of the curve), a fee is what the portfolio
 * *costs to hold* (internal, and therefore a drag). Before this kind existed a
 * recurring custody fee could only be entered as a withdrawal, which reported a
 * fee-eaten portfolio as if it performed exactly like a fee-free one — the gap
 * the return-series audit found. Always negative; see
 * {@link EXTERNAL_CASH_MOVEMENT_KINDS} for the full argument.
 *
 * **Data model.** A movement is `kind + signed EUR amount + ISO-8601 timestamp`.
 * The sign is part of the data (not derived): inflow kinds (`deposit`,
 * `sell_proceeds`) carry a strictly positive `amountEur`, outflow kinds
 * (`withdrawal`, `buy`) a strictly negative one, and a sign/kind mismatch or a
 * zero amount fails loud with {@link CashLedgerError} — the ledger never
 * guesses a direction. With that invariant, **current cash = sum of signed
 * movements**, the #220 reconciliation invariant, and {@link cashBalance} is
 * literally that sum (in input order, full FP precision, §5.4 — display
 * rounding lives in the display layer).
 *
 * **No silent negative balances** (#220). {@link applyCashMovement} is the
 * single admission gate: it returns the balance after a movement or throws the
 * typed {@link InsufficientCashError} (carrying the available balance and the
 * exact shortfall — everything a "available → after" preview or a 4xx needs).
 * {@link projectCashLedger} replays a whole history chronologically
 * (`occurredAt`, ties broken by input order, mirroring `holdings`' transaction
 * ordering) through that same gate and returns the running balance after every
 * movement — which doubles as the balance-over-time series for the later
 * overview wiring ({@link cashBalanceOverTime} condenses it to end-of-day
 * points). Balances within {@link CASH_EPSILON} of zero count as zero, so FP
 * dust from decimal EUR amounts (0.1 + 0.2 − 0.3) never fabricates an
 * insufficient-cash rejection; the check is a tolerance only — amounts are
 * never rounded or clamped mid-computation.
 *
 * **TWR integrity — the hard requirement.** Buying from cash is **not** a new
 * external cash flow: money already inside the portfolio merely changed form
 * (cash → shares), so it must not register as a deposit in the performance-%
 * curve. This module is the authoritative classifier:
 * {@link externalCashFlowsForTwr} returns **only** `deposit` / `withdrawal`
 * movements — aggregated per day, sparse, ascending, in the exact
 * {@link FlowPoint} shape `timeWeightedReturn` consumes — while `buy` /
 * `sell_proceeds` are internal and excluded. Two wiring rules follow for the
 * service (#311): (1) the value series fed to `timeWeightedReturn` must
 * *include* the cash balance (deposit day: value +1000 with a +1000 flow →
 * flat; buy day: value unchanged, no flow → flat) — {@link netWorthSeries}
 * builds exactly that series; (2) a cash-funded buy/sell transaction must
 * **not** additionally enter `netFlowsOverTime` — its external flow was
 * already booked when the cash was deposited, and counting it again would
 * double the flow.

 * (V3-P3): a transfer moves money between two sources *inside* the portfolio,
 * so it is NEVER an external flow (its paired legs also cancel to zero in every
 * roll-up, keeping net worth unchanged). The V3-P4 tax kinds are internal too
 * (§16 2026-07-08): a `dividend` is income the portfolio's assets *generated*
 * — counting it as a deposit would neutralize it out of the performance curve
 * and understate the true return — and `tax_withholding` / `tax_refund` are
 * costs of holding the portfolio, kept inside the curve so performance reads
 * net of taxes, exactly as it already reads net of fees.
 *
 * **`fee` is internal, and that is the whole point of the kind** (V5, §16
 * 2026-07-30). A custody / account / platform fee is a **cost of holding**, not
 * money the owner chose to take out: the portfolio is worth less afterwards
 * *because of what it costs to run*, so the fee must **drag** the return.
 * Classifying it external — which is all a `withdrawal` could ever have done —
 * would divide it back out of the curve and report a portfolio that silently
 * eats 0.5 % a year as if it did not. This is the same reasoning that keeps
 * `tax_withholding` inside the curve, and it makes a standing fee read exactly
 * like the per-trade `fee` that already rides a transaction's cost basis. The
 * consequence is deliberate and is pinned by test: a fee lowers `performance[]`
 * while a withdrawal of the same amount on the same day does not.
 *
 * NOTE — "external" here means **external to the portfolio's return**, which is
 * a narrower notion than "hand-entered". MIRRORCHAIN replicates a `fee` exactly
 * like a deposit/withdrawal (a member typed it; it is not re-derived per copy),
 * so `mirrorService`'s replication predicate deliberately does NOT reuse this

 * per calendar day: cash deposited before the first transaction is part of the
